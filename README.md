# Vanilla Flappie Bird

![](https://img.shields.io/badge/just%20for%20fun-blueviolet)

This is a simple HTML/CSS/Javascript psuedo flappy bird. Thanks to [Leonardo Leit√£o](https://github.com/leonardomleitao), I watched some of his videos about web develop and it gave me knowledge to build this Flappie, and thanks to this random [pen](https://codepen.io/maxjf1/pen/ydMqGR?editors=1000) with a bird' impulse logic (?). So yea, that's it, any questions, [email me](mailto:ariannemacena@gmail.com).
